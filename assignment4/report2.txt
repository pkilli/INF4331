Using the vectorized version makes the runtime significantly better. How much is
gained by switching to numpy?
mandelbrot_data_numpy, time_numpy 	= mandelbrot_2.mandelbrot(-2,2.,-2,2,1000,1000,50)
mandelbrot_data_python, time_python = mandelbrot_1.mandelbrot(-2,2.,-2,2,1000,1000,50)
Running both programs with these numbers gives cpu times as follows:
numpy mandelbrot: 0.8141579999999999
python mandelbrot: 101.401939
